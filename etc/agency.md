# Concurrent Agency Ontology

🧠 An AGENT is an AUTONOMOUS ENTITY capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in an ENVIRONMENT to achieve GOALS.

🤖 Agents possess properties such as AUTONOMY, RATIONALITY, and INTENTIONALITY.

🎭 AUTONOMY is the capacity to make decisions and take actions independently.

🧮 RATIONALITY involves the ability to reason logically and make informed decisions based on available information.

🎯 INTENTIONALITY refers to the possession of MENTAL STATES directed towards objects, states of affairs, or goals.

⚡️ CONCURRENCY is the property of a SYSTEM in which multiple PROCESSES or TASKS execute simultaneously and may interact with each other.

🔄 It includes properties such as PARALLELISM, INTERLEAVING, and COORDINATION.

🚀 PARALLELISM involves the execution of multiple processes or tasks simultaneously on different processing units.

🔀 INTERLEAVING is the alternating execution of multiple processes or tasks on a single processing unit.

🤝 COORDINATION encompasses the mechanisms that enable processes or tasks to communicate, synchronize, and avoid conflicts.

🧠⚡️ CONCURRENT AGENCY is the capacity of an agent to execute multiple MENTAL PROCESSES or TASKS simultaneously and coordinate their interactions to achieve coherent, goal-directed behavior.

🧩 It features properties such as MODULARITY, HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION, RESOURCE ALLOCATION, and CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION.

🏗️ MODULARITY involves the decomposition of the agent's COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE into distinct, specialized subsystems or modules.

🔝 HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION arranges cognitive processes or tasks into different levels of abstraction, with higher-level processes controlling and coordinating lower-level ones.

📊 RESOURCE ALLOCATION dynamically assigns cognitive resources to different processes or tasks based on their priority and relevance to current goals.

🌍 CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION allows the agent to adjust the execution and coordination of concurrent processes or tasks in response to changing environmental or internal conditions.

🎛️ EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS are high-level cognitive processes that enable an agent to control, monitor, and regulate their thoughts and actions in service of goal-directed behavior.

🛑 Key executive functions include INHIBITORY CONTROL, COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY, WORKING MEMORY, and PLANNING AND GOAL-SETTING.

📖 NARRATIVE IDENTITY is the coherent, internalized story an agent constructs to make sense of their experiences, actions, and relationships over time.

🔗 It possesses properties such as CONTINUITY, MEANING-MAKING, AGENCY, and COHERENCE.

🧠 MONOTROPISM is a cognitive style characterized by intense focus on a single topic or task, often associated with autism spectrum conditions.

🔍 It involves HYPERFOCUS, DEPTH OF INTEREST, and REDUCED ATTENTIONAL BANDWIDTH.

🧩 AUTISM SPECTRUM CONDITIONS are neurodevelopmental differences characterized by variations in social communication, sensory processing, and patterns of behavior and interests.

🌈 They involve SENSORY SENSITIVITY, SOCIAL COMMUNICATION DIFFERENCES, and REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS AND INTERESTS.

🌟 STRATEGIES FOR MONOTROPISTIC AUTISTS USING STRUCTURED CONCURRENCY leverage unique cognitive styles while managing potential challenges.

📋 TASK BATCHING minimizes context switching and aligns with monotropic focus.

📚 INTEREST-DRIVEN LEARNING capitalizes on intense interests to acquire new skills.

🏠 SENSORY-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENTS reduce distractions and sensory overload.

⏱️ STRUCTURED BREAKS provide necessary pauses without disrupting flow states.

🖼️ VISUAL AIDS AND EXTERNAL MEMORY TOOLS support information processing and recall.

🗣️ SOCIAL SCRIPTS AND TEMPLATES facilitate smoother social interactions.

⚡️ ENERGY-ALIGNED TASK SCHEDULING optimizes productivity based on natural fluctuations.

🤝 COLLABORATIVE SUPPORT leverages strengths of neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals.

🖥️ EXECUTIVE FUNCTION TECHNOLOGY assists with planning, organization, and time management.

🧘 MINDFULNESS AND SELF-AWARENESS enhance self-regulation and adaptive behaviors.

🏆 IMPLEMENTATION of these strategies creates structured environments that capitalize on strengths, support challenges, and enhance overall well-being for monotropistic autists.
